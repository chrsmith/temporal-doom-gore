// Multiplayer for the step API.

// Vanilla DOOM's netcode is lockstep: every node runs the whole simulation,
// and a tic only runs once every player's ticcmd for it has arrived. A step
// host does the same thing with StepNetTic, feeding the ticcmds of every
// player in the game. Start the engine with "-solo-net" (and optionally
// "-deathmatch") so the netgame rules apply: respawning instead of
// restarting the level, multiplayer-only things, and so on.
//
// Vanilla fixes the set of players when the game starts. Step hosts can
// add and remove players between tics instead. Membership changes are part
// of the tic, so every node applies them at the same moment.
